This file is part of GCC.
GCC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 3, or (at your option) any later version.
GCC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
Under Section 7 of GPL version 3, you are granted additional permissions
described in the GCC Runtime Library Exception, version 3.1, as published by
the Free Software Foundation.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License and a copy
of the GCC Runtime Library Exception along with this program; see the files
COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME respectively. If not, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional permission
under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It
applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that bears a notice placed by
the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3
along with this Exception.
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain
GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose
of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary)
programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered
by this Exception.
0. Definitions.
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime Library
for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface
provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime
Library.
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the
GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent
versions published by the FSF.
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the
license of GCC.
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target
processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an
assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that,
Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler
intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate
representation.
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in nonintermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java
Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source
code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the
Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as
starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or with
other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based
on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC
intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation
Process.
1. Grant of Additional Permission.
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining
the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would
otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was
generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a
combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the
Independent Modules.
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption
that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the
license of GCC

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.
This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General
Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file that bears a
notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is
governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf's typical
output under terms of the recipient's choice (including proprietary).
0. Definitions.
"Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf that is
a covered work under this License.
"Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of its
Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not from its
input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and non-tracing output.
"Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.
1. Grant of Additional Permission.
You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such propagation
would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3. However, if by modifying Autoconf
you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you received to become Normally
Copied Code of your modified version, then you void this Exception for the
resulting covered work. If you convey that resulting covered work, you must
remove this Exception in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 7 of
GPLv3.
2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption
that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the
